### Notes
Things you can't do:
  * You can't alter existing features.
  * We don't provide a way to charge users for add-ons.
  * Using Apps Script libraries will cause your add-on to run more slowly if all the server-side code were contained in a single script project. Suggest copy the contents of library into your main script.
